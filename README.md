## Survey Papers
#### [A Survey on Deep Domain Adaptation for LiDAR Perception](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02377.pdf)
## Domain Invariant Data
### Sensor-to-Sensor
#### [CNN-based synthesis of realistic high-resolution LiDAR data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00787.pdf) 
Compare down-upsampled with original range images via pointwise/perceptive/semantic losses. \
Reproducibility: Hard / No Code
#### [Simulation-based Lidar Super-resolution for Ground Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05242.pdf) 
Use U-Net with droupout on range image to upsample simulated environments with different sensors. Any super resolution model would likely perform similar, mentioning effect of drop out rate. \
Reproducibility: Hard (Custom-Simulation Data) / [Code](https://github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/lidar_super_resolution) 
#### [Improved Semantic Segmentation of Low-Resolution 3D Point Clouds Using Supervised Domain Adaptation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9257903) 
TBD 
#### [Analyzing the Cross-Sensor Portability of Neural Network Architectures for LiDAR-based Semantic Labeling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.02149.pdf)
2D-3D labelling transfer mechanism with different sensor cross tests, no specific adaptation mechanism is proposed.
### Dataset-to-Dataset
[Complete & Label: A Domain Adaptation Approach to Semantic Segmentation of LiDAR Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08488.pdf)
Create incomplete versions of original lidars and train a voxel based sparse convolution completer. \
Reproducibility: Hard / No Code
## Domain Mapping 
### Dataset-to-Dataset
#### [Domain Adaptation for Vehicle Detection from Birdâ€™s Eye View LiDAR Point Cloud Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.08955.pdf)
Using GAN to make synthethic LIDAR-BEV data more realistic improve BEV-YOLO detector \ 
#### [LiDAR Sensor modeling and Data augmentation with GANs for Autonomous driving](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07290.pdf)
Cycle GAN over BEV-LIDAR of synthetic data to improve performance of YOLO-R over KITTI. [50] is pretty much same work by same authors.\ 
### Sim-to-Real
